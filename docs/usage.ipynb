    "# MyST-NB Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The (probably) most useful function of this library is the `myst_nb_metadata_injector`.\n",
    "This allows you to write _magic-comments_ inside of your Jupyter code cells to inject metadata into those cells and configure the execution/rendering behavior of the [MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with a simple comment like `# remove-input` you can hide the code cell in your rendered documentation and only show the output without having to fight with setting the metadata tags of your code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation for this functionality is to keep the configuration _local_ and not hide it behind an `metadata` window inside of the Jupyter Notebook UI.\n",
    "This is especially frustrating for users that use UIs that do not support configuring the code cell metadata, like VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for defining these options _in-line_ as comments comes from the awesome [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) library that takes a very different approach and uses notebooks as the source for _everything_. They generate the source code, documentation, and tests from notebooks.\n",
    "It is quite an interesting approach, that I would suggest everyone to talk a look at ðŸ˜ƒ."

    "\n",
    "You can rename your notebooks with a different extension (only characters after the last `.` are considered the extension) and use that option for the custom parser instead.\n",
